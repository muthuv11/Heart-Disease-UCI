# Heart Disease Prediction (Python)

### Problem Definition

This project aims to developed and deployed a to predict certain cardiovascular events or find any clear indications of heart disease. It answers the question of Identifying the attributes which explains the prediction.

### Dataset Information

Data Set Characteristics:  Multivariate
Number of Instances:303
Associated Tasks:Classification

### Background

This notebook demonstrates the entire data science process of building a predictive model that can hypothetically identify heart disease baes on the attributes defined. The processes involving defining the problem, preprocessing data, EDA, developing model, and deploying. This project aims to build a scalable and deployable model. Here are the breakdown of my project.

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing, checking for collearity, outliers, missing data.
2. Exploratory data analysis to examine the distribution of the target variable and its correlation with categorical and numerical features.
3. Baseline Model and Compared Models with different metrics to choose best performing model.
4. Models tuning using gridsearch_cv
5. Feature importance data visualization 
6. Deploy and save the final model into production using Pipeline.
